TrainStack is a game built for the 36th Ludum Dare, with the theme
"Ancient Technology." This game is based on the concept of trains as an
"ancient" technology.

It is supposedly a puzzle game, although the levels are mostly pretty easy due
to how they were built.

Instructions are contained within the game itself. It is a Java program - most
computers will run it on double-click, but some will not, and normally then you
have to go into a command line.

Be aware that this game makes a file called "ld36-trainstack-save.txt" in its
Java "running directory" - for some computers, this is the directory where the
program file is stored, while in others it is actually a different folder, such
as the user home folder. If you already have a file called
"ld36-trainstack-save.txt" you should move or rename it.

This game is licensed under the MIT license. The license should be under this
directory along with the game.
